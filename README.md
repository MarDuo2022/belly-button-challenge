# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 challenge Javascript

Aim:  build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site., which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard has been deployed to: https://marduo2022.github.io/belly-button-challenge/


##Instructions:

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.


Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. 

Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file.

Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional with no extra points earning)
The following task is advanced and therefore optional.

Adapt the Gauge Chart from https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/ Links to an external site.to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.
